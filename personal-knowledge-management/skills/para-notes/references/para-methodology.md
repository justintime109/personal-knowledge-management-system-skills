# PARA Methodology Reference

## Definitions

### Projects
A series of tasks linked to a goal, with a deadline or specific outcome.

- Has a clear definition of "done"
- Time-bound (even if the deadline is self-imposed)
- Requires multiple tasks to complete
- Examples: Launch website redesign, Complete tax filing, Plan vacation to Japan

### Areas
Spheres of activity with a standard to maintain over time.

- No end date — ongoing responsibilities
- Has a standard or quality level to uphold
- Examples: Health, Finances, Professional Development, Home Maintenance, Relationships

### Resources
Topics or themes of ongoing interest.

- Reference material for future use
- No active commitment or standard
- Examples: Marketing strategies, Recipes, Programming languages, Book notes

### Archives
Inactive items from the other three categories.

- Completed projects
- Areas no longer active
- Resources no longer relevant
- Preserved for future reference, not actively maintained

## Decision Tree for Categorization

When a new note arrives, ask these questions in order:

1. **Is this tied to a specific outcome with a deadline?** → Project
2. **Is this an ongoing responsibility I need to maintain?** → Area
3. **Is this interesting reference material?** → Resource
4. **Is this no longer active but worth keeping?** → Archive

If uncertain between Project and Area: if there's a finish line, it's a Project. If it's a standard to maintain indefinitely, it's an Area.

If uncertain between Area and Resource: if there's a personal commitment or responsibility, it's an Area. If it's just interesting, it's a Resource.

## Promotion and Demotion Rules

### Promote (move forward)
- **Resource → Project**: When a topic of interest becomes an active initiative with a goal
- **Archive → Project**: When a completed project gets revived or revisited
- **Resource → Area**: When casual interest becomes an ongoing responsibility

### Demote (move back)
- **Project → Archive**: When a project is completed or abandoned
- **Area → Archive**: When a responsibility ends (e.g., sold a property)
- **Project → Resource**: When an active project is paused indefinitely but the research is still useful
- **Area → Resource**: When an area is no longer a responsibility but the knowledge is still useful

### Review Triggers
- Project with no edits in 30+ days → consider archiving or identifying a next action
- Resource not accessed in 90+ days → consider archiving
- Area with zero notes → question whether it's truly an active area
- Archive items → leave alone unless reactivating
