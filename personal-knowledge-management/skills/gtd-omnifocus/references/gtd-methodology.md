# GTD Methodology Reference

## The Five Phases

### 1. Capture
Collect everything that has your attention into a trusted system.

- Get it out of your head and into the inbox
- Capture tools: OmniFocus inbox, quick capture shortcut, email-to-OF
- Rule: capture everything, decide nothing at this stage

### 2. Clarify
Process each item: what is it? Is it actionable?

**Decision tree for each inbox item:**

1. **What is it?** — Identify the item clearly
2. **Is it actionable?**
   - **No →** Choose one:
     - **Trash**: Not needed, delete it
     - **Someday/Maybe**: Might want to do later, incubate it
     - **Reference**: Useful info, file it (consider PARA notes)
   - **Yes →** Continue:
3. **What's the next action?** — Define the very next physical action
4. **Will it take less than 2 minutes?**
   - **Yes →** Do it now (two-minute rule)
   - **No →** Continue:
5. **Am I the right person?**
   - **No →** Delegate it (add "Waiting For" tag with person and date)
   - **Yes →** Continue:
6. **Is it a single action or multi-step?**
   - **Single →** Add to appropriate context list
   - **Multi-step →** Create a project, define next action

### 3. Organize
Put clarified items where they belong.

- **Projects**: Any outcome requiring 2+ actions
- **Next Actions**: Organized by context (where/tool needed)
- **Waiting For**: Delegated items with who and when
- **Calendar**: Date-specific actions and deadlines
- **Someday/Maybe**: Items to review later

### 4. Reflect
Review the system regularly to maintain trust.

- **Daily**: Check calendar and next action lists
- **Weekly**: Full weekly review (see below)

### 5. Engage
Choose what to do based on:
1. Context (where are you, what tools available?)
2. Time available
3. Energy level
4. Priority

## Weekly Review Checklist

### Get Clear
- [ ] Process inbox to zero
- [ ] Collect loose papers, notes, ideas
- [ ] Empty head — capture any new items

### Get Current
- [ ] Review next action lists — mark off completed, add new
- [ ] Review calendar (past week) — any follow-ups needed?
- [ ] Review calendar (upcoming) — any prep needed?
- [ ] Review Waiting For list — any follow-ups to send?
- [ ] Review each active project — does each have a next action?
- [ ] Review any relevant checklists

### Get Creative
- [ ] Review Someday/Maybe list — promote or remove items
- [ ] Review goals and objectives — any new projects needed?
- [ ] Be creative — capture any new ideas or wild thoughts

## The Two-Minute Rule

If the next action takes less than two minutes, do it immediately. The overhead of tracking it exceeds the effort of just doing it.

## Someday/Maybe Rules

- Review during weekly review
- Items that excite you → promote to active project
- Items that no longer interest you → delete
- Items unchanged for 3+ reviews → consider deleting
- Not a dumping ground — curate actively

## Natural Planning Model (for project planning)

1. **Purpose**: Why are we doing this?
2. **Vision**: What does wild success look like?
3. **Brainstorm**: What are all the things that need to happen?
4. **Organize**: What's the sequence? What depends on what?
5. **Next Actions**: What's the very next physical action?
